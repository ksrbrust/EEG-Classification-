## EEG-Classification-Model

* Data Preprocessing: <br>
o Download and extract the datasets. <br>
o Explore the data to understand its structure and characteristics. <br>
o If necessary, preprocess the EEG data, including handling missing values, noise reduction, and data augmentation. <br>

* Feature Extraction: <br>
o Extract relevant features from the EEG signals. You may consider time-domain and frequency-domain features.<br>

* Data Splitting: <br>
o Split the data into training, validation, and test sets. <br>

* Model Selection: <br>
o Choose an appropriate machine learning or deep learning model for EEG classification. Consider models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). <br>

* Model Training: <br>
o Train your chosen model on the training data using appropriate training techniques. <br>
o Implement strategies to avoid overfitting, such as dropout or early stopping. <br>

* Model Evaluation: <br>
o Evaluate your model's performance on the validation set using relevant evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score). <br>
o Fine-tune hyperparameters as needed to optimize performance. <br>

* Testing: <br>
o Assess the final model on the test set to ensure its generalization capability. <br>

* Results and Visualization: 
o Visualize the EEG data and model predictions. Create plots and graphs to illustrate your findings.<br>
